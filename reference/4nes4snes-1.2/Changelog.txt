--- v1.2 (May 2, 2009)
- License changed to GPLv2
- Implemented "Live autodetection". This allows NES and SNES controllers to be
changed at runtime. This features can be disabled by closing JP1.
- Added NES fourscore support. When a fourscore is detected in port 1, fourscore
mode is entered and ports 1 and 2 are used to read up to 4 NES controllers.

--- v1.1 (18 Apr 2007)
- Changed report descriptor. There are now four separate report IDs, one
per controller. This was necessary because even though all axis and buttons
were perfectly functional in 'control panel -> game controllers', it was not
the case in many games, including zsnes and snes9x!
- Changed device id to 0x0A9D

--- v1.0 (24 Mar 2007)
Initial release.
